Blog 1: The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

What are Union and Intersection Types?

Imagine a variable that can hold either a string or a number. This is a union type. It can be one or the other.

Now, imagine a variable that must have both a name and an age. This is an intersection type. It must have both properties.

Why are they useful?

These types help us write cleaner and more reliable code in TypeScript. Here's how:

Flexible Functions:

Union Types: You can write functions that can accept different types of input. For example, a function that can calculate the length of either a string or an array.
Intersection Types: You can write functions that expect input with specific properties. For example, a function that requires an object with both a name and an age property.
Modeling Complex Data:

Union Types: You can represent data that can take different forms. For example, a value that could be a number, a string, or an array.
Intersection Types: You can model objects with multiple roles or responsibilities. For example, a person who is also a developer.
Example:

TypeScript
// Union Type: A value can be either a string or a number
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

// Intersection Type: A person must have a name and an age
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Developer {
  skills: string[];
}

type PersonDeveloper = Person & Developer; // A person who is also a developer

const personDeveloper: PersonDeveloper = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 30,
  skills: ['TypeScript', 'React']
};


In summary: 

Use them wisely to avoid making your code too complex.
Use type guards to check the actual type of a value when working with union types.
Consider using discriminated unions to define a union type where one property distinguishes between different types.
By understanding and using union and intersection types effectively, you can write more robust, type-safe, and maintainable TypeScript code.
